The project was too heavy, so I only uploaded the files I added or changed.

The difference between Blazor Server and Wasm is that the latter works with the client side and is a replacement for frameworks like angular, react and vue.

In Wasm we can't store data just like that, we need to use Api to connect to the Data Access Layer.

In my case, I don't need to work with any amount of data, so the code is identical to what I wrote for the Blazor Server.
